# list of usernames exempt from pcull
#
# Exemptions are regular expressions, but word boundaries are automatically 
# applied (so if you don't want that, wrap the entry with .* or something 
# similar).
#
# Blank lines, lines containing just whitespace, and comments (text that starts 
# with the # character, whether on a line by itself or appended to an entry) 
# are ignored.

root  #(always excluded anyways, but just to be explicit)
