#
# list of process names exempt from pcull
#
# Exemptions are regular expressions, but word boundaries are automatically 
# applied (so if you don't want that, wrap the entry with .* or something 
# similar).  They're matched to the output of top, which is just the 
# executable and not the full command line.
#
# Blank lines, lines containing just whitespace, and comments (text that starts 
# with the # character, whether on a line by itself or appended to an entry) 
# are ignored.
#

#(some of the following may always be owned by root and ignored anyways)

#lustre
ll_sa

#lsf
mbatchd
mbschd
sbatchd
lim
pim
res
nios

#nx (only applicable to iliadnx, but it doesn't hurt)

nxagent

#sshd and shells -- note the leading -, i.e. only login shells (and not scripts) are exempt
